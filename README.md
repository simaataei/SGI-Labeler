The Substrate Group of Interest (SGI) labeler is an automated pipeline used to build a dataset of transport proteins as the data samples that are labeled with their specific transported substrate. Since this pipeline relies on the Chebi and GO term annotations, it can be used to construct various datasets for proteins and their associated substrates. It is not limited to building datasets solely for transport proteins. Still, it could generate datasets for other domains such as metabolic and biosynthetic processes, as well as protein-ligand binding, and more.
